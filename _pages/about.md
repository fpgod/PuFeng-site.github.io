My name is pronounced as shin-yoo. I am a Ph.D. student at the State Key Laboratory of Software Development Environment (SKLSDE) and School of Computer Science and Engineering (SCSE) , Beihang University, Beijing, China, supervised by Prof. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wenjun-Wu-15">Wenjun Wu</a> and <a href="https://rongyeshi.github.io/">Rongye Shi</a>.

Research
======
My research focuses on controlling multi-robot systems through multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). To address the practical training challenges of reinforcement learning (RL), I integrate domain expertise with RL to improve sample efficiency and convergence. This strategy not only mitigates the practical training constraints of RL but also expands the applicability of MARL in multi-robot operations. In addition, I am interested in Imitation Learning, Embodied AI based on Large Language Models (LLM), and Robust MARL.
