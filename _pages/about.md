I am a Ph.D. student at the State Key Laboratory of Software Development Environment (SKLSDE) and School of Computer Science and Engineering (SCSE) , Beihang University, Beijing, China, supervised by Prof. Wenjun Wu.

Research
======
My research focuses on multi-agent reinforcement learning. My goal is to enhance the performance of reinforcement learning by leveraging prior knowledge, particularly physics knowledge. Additionally, I have a strong interest in the robustness of multi-agent reinforcement learning.
